## What needs to be configured?
In principle: nothing. *Adebar* should run fine out-of-the-box, as it comes with
a decent „default configuration“ coded into the main script itself. So if you
first just want to give it a look, you can skip this section and start *Adebar*
straight away. Come back here if you feel the need to fine-tune things.


## Where does *Adebar* check for configuration files?
When running, *Adebar* first sets up „default values“, and then checks for an existing config file:

* if `config/` is a directory, and contains a file with the same name
  as specified by the first command-line parameter, this is used. This
  allows for device-specific config files if you have more than one
  device.
* otherwise, if `config/` is a directory, and contains a file named
  `default`, this will be used. You might want to have that for e.g.
  "guest devices" or as a default for possible „new ones“
* otherwise, if `config` is a file, that will be used. Makes it easier
  if you only have one device, and don't plan for more.

A sample configuration file is included as `doc/config.sample`, which you
simply can copy and adjust. Your config file has only to contain the
settings you wish to change; this will usually be the `DEVICE_IP` (which is not
set by default) and/or the `STORAGE_BASE`. For an easy quick-start, there's
also `doc/quickstart_config.sample` concentrating on essential things (like
the „user function“ to assemble the final device documentation).


## What settings are available, and what do they mean?
A short information for each setting is contained in the example config file, where all available settings are included. Here comes a more detailed description:

### Directory Settings
* `STORAGE_BASE`: that's the „base directory“ everything goes below. Here
  the command-line provided `OUTDIR` will be appended to. By default, this
  variable is empty, so `OUTDIR` is relative to the execution path. If you
  e.g. set it as `STORAGE_PATH=/home/me/backups`, and pass `moto_x` as
  parameter to `adebar_cli`, your files should end up below
  `/home/me/backups/moto_x`.
* `DUMMY_BASE`: where your [[Dummy-Devices]] are located. You probably won't need this.
* `USERDIR`: sub-directory where the backup scripts will place the ADB backups
  of your user-apps into (relative to where they're run). Default is "userApps".
* `SYSDIR`: Similar, for the data backups of your system apps. Defaults to "sysApps".
* `PARTBACKUPDIR`: again similar, for partition images
* `DOCDIR`: Where to place created documentary files. Default is "docs", which results
  in `${STORAGE_PATH}/${OUTDIR}/docs`
* `CONFDIR`: Similar for pulled config files (`conf/`). Default is "conf", which has
  the device's config files placed in `${STORAGE_PATH}/${OUTDIR}/conf`.
* `CACHEDIR`: In the cache directory, Adebar stores data between runs –
  so it does not have to re-evaluate them. This includes e.g. names of apps
  in the `appnames` sub-directory. Leave it empty (default) to disable caching.
* `APPCACHESPLUS`: additional directories where *Adebar* should look for information
  on app names. By default, this is empty. An example line fitting for all devices
  could look like:  
  `APPCACHESPLUS="sysApps sysApps/Android sysApps/Google"`  
  Of course, this only makes sense if you also have the corresponding "cache files".
  See the [Adebar-Appcache](https://github.com/IzzySoft/Adebar-Appcache) project
  for details – and get your initial filling from there :)
* `TRANSFER_DIR`: base dir for transfers (install, push files, etc.). Completely
  ignored if not set in your config (default), if the directory pointed to does
  not exist, and skipped for the subdirs not existing as well. *Adebar* checks
  for the following directories below this:
    * `install`: first-time install of apps. Simply drop your `.apk` files here.
      `.apk` files are kept if installation failed, but are deleted after a
      successful install.
    * `reinstall`: same, for updates to apps already installed. If you get the
      error `INSTALL_FAILED_ALREADY_EXISTS` with the `install` dir, move that
      `.apk` here.
    * `upload`: stuff to be pushed to the device. Setup the same directory
      structure here as it is on the device; if you e.g. wish to push `example.epub`
      to `/sdcard/Books/example.epub`, you'll have to place it into
      `${TRANSFER_DIR}/upload/sdcard/Books/example.epub`. If the transfer
      succeeded, the entire tree (starting with `sdcard`) will be removed; on
      failure it will remain.
    * `special`: special transfers that go beyond simply uploading some files.
      You control the process via an executable file named `run` placed inside
      this directory, which should exit with a return code of 0 on success and
      a non-zero return code on failure. This way you can also rename files on
      the device – useful e.g. if you want to push a new `lacells.db` for the
      [Local-GSM-Backend project by n76](https://github.com/n76/Local-GSM-Backend),
      where you first need to push a huge file and, when the upload is completed,
      need to rename it so the app can grab it.  
      An example `run` file can be found as `doc/run.sample`.

### Device specifics
* `DEVICE_NAME`: A name you can recognize your device by. This is used
  for the documentory files such as [[deviceInfo.md|example deviceInfo.md]],
  but also in scripts (mainly for headers in both cases). Defaults to "MyDroid".
* `SERIAL`: The device's serial as returned by `adb devices`. By default this
  is empty. It's not strictly needed as long as you only have one device
  connected when running `adebar-cli`. If there are multiple devices connected,
  *Adebar* uses the `SERIAL` to tell ADB which one to use.
* `DUMMY`: if this config belongs to a [[Dummy-Device]], this specifies its name
  (which is also the directory name inside `DUMMY_BASE` where its data are stored).

### Settings for Titanium Backup
*Titanium Backup* features an integrated web server to obtain device contents from.
*Adebar* can create a script to do that for you, which is what these settings are for.

* `DEVICE_IP`: IP address of your device. By default this is empty, so the TiBu
  part will be skipped.
* `TIBU_PORT`: port the *TiBu* web server listens on. Default is "8080".
* `TIBU_SDINT`: URL path to obtain contents of the internal SD. Default is
  "/storage/INTERNAL/Storage-ALL.zip"
* `TIBU_SDEXT`: URL path to obtain contents of the external SD. Default is
  "/storage/SAMSUNG_EXT_SD_CARD/Storage-ALL.zip"
* `TIBU_BACKUPS`: URL path to obtain the *TiBu* backups. Default is "/TitaniumBackup-ALL.zip"

### Features
While *Adebar* can create a lot of files containing details from your device, you might
not have use for all of them, and thus wish to „skip“ some parts. You can do so by enabling
or disabling the corresponding feature. These settings are „booleans“, so `0` means „off“
and `1` stands for „on”. By default, all features are enabled (i.e. set to `1`).

* `MK_APPDISABLE`: create a script to „freeze/disable“ apps
* `MK_APPENABLE`:  create a script to enable ALL apps. Useful in case you once
  disable one too much and have no GUI anymore on your device :)
* `MK_USERBACKUP`/`MK_SYSBACKUP`: create the script to backup user apps+data /
  system app-data
* `AUTO_BACKUP_SHARED`: shall shared storage be backed up automatically, without
  you being asked? If set to `0` you will be asked, with `1` the backup will
  be performed automatically.
* `SKIP_EXISTING_USERBACKUP`/`SKIP_EXISTING_SYSBACKUP`: if you e.g. had already
  started a backup, but needed to abort it (might have been needed if `adbd`
  got stuck, which happens with some devices/ROMs if `adb backup` commands are
  issued too fast – see `MK_AUTOCONFIRM_DELAY` below for a preventive measure
  to that), you might wish *Adebar* to skip already succeeded backups (that is,
  where the backup file already exists and is not empty). Set the corresponding
  option to `1` for that – or set it to `0` if you don't want this.
* `RETRY_FAILED_BACKUPS`: when the backup run is completed, *Adebar* can check
  for „failed backups“ (usually backup files with a size of 41 byte, but also
  empty ones) and try to repeat the backup of corresponding apps. On some devices,
  this succeeds in a subsequent run (mostly due to a „buggy `adbd`“ on the device).
  It will however *not* succeed, regardless how often you try, if the dev decided
  declaring the app `ALLOW_BACKUP:FALSE`. Set to `1` to be prompted for retries,
  or to `0` if you don't need/want this.
* `MK_APPRESTORE_DELAY`: on restore, ADB sometimes simply „aborts“ when a second
  restore command comes in while it's still processing the first – so subsequent
  commands get lost (waiting for the user to accept them on the device which
  doesn't prompt for it). Hence you can configure how to deal with that (you can
  play with the values to find what fits you best):
    * `p` will prompt you on the computer when to send the next command
    * `0` will simply „hammer them in“ expecting the device to cope with it
    * an integer value larger than `0` will pause for that amount of seconds
      before sending the next `adb restore` command.
* `MK_AUTOCONFIRM_DELAY`: Similarly, if using `AUTO_CONFIRM`, you can specify a
  delay in seconds to give the device time to act. Default is 3.
* `MK_AUTOCONFIRM_SEQUENCE`: the sequence of [keycodes][2] sent to the device
  to confirm each app backup. Default is `(22 23)`, which works fine on many
  devices – but for example not on some Xiaomis, which need `(61 61 61 66)`.
  Please report back if you found another device specific sequence, so it can
  be documented here.
* `MK_AUTOCONFIRM_SEQUENCE_2`: if your device requires a different confirmation
  sequence on restore (some Xiaomis again with `(61 61 66)`), and only then,
  set this variable in your device config. Else leave it empty, and
  `MK_AUTOCONFIRM_SEQUENCE` will be used.
* `MK_XPRIVACY_EXPORT`: whether to trigger a data export of XPrivacy. Disabled (`0`)
  by default, so Adebar doesn't have to check for its presence unnecessarily.
  Set to `1` to enable it.
* `MK_XPRIVACY_PULL`: whether to pull XPrivacy's databases. Disabled (`0`) by
  default as it requires root; set to `1` to enable it.
* `PULL_SETTINGS`: pull settings/configs from the device (currently just
  `wpa_supplicant.conf`, but there might be more in the future)
* `MK_TIBU`: create the script to pull stuff from the TiBu web server.
  Even if set to `1`, this will be disabled if you didn't set a `DEVICE_IP`
  (see above in „Settings for Titanium Backup“).
* `MK_USERAPPS`: Creates the *script* to deal with "disabled components",
  plus the markup document holding details on installed apps and their sources
  ([[userApps.md|example userApps.md]]). Enabled by default.
* `MK_SYSAPPS`: similarly for system apps. Enabled by default.
' `MK_SYSAPPS_RETRIEVE_NAMES`: Whether we should try to retrieve app names for
  system apps as well (if the corresponding user function was defined by
  `APPNAME_CMD`). This is disabled by default, as it slows down the process
  of creating the `sysApps.md` file tremendously, and most app names are not
  found anyway. You may use this once initially, but then it's recommended to
  switch it off again.  
  Some „pre-configured files“ for system apps can be found in the [Download area
  at IzzyOnDroid][1].
* `MK_INSTALLLOC`: Deal with the default-install-location (where apps should
  be installed by default: 0=auto (system decides), 1=device, 2=sdcard).
  Creates a 1-liner script to set that again.
* `MK_PARTBACKUP`: Create a script to backup storage partitions (raw backup
  images). Turned OFF by default.
    * `PARTITION_SRC`: Where to obtain the partition details from. Reliability
      of sources differs between manufacturers, devices, ROMs, and possible
      other modifications. If this is set to "auto", *Adebar* tries to figure
      the best source itself. It currently considers `/proc/mtd`, `/proc/emmc`,
      `/dev/block/platform/*/by-name`, `/proc/partitions`, and `/proc/mounts`.
      Moreover, found details are sometimes combined from different sources.
      If for your device, *Adebar* seems to use the wrong source, or you want
      to "speed up" things a little, you can define the source to be used with
      this setting. Available options are currently: auto|mtd|emmc|byname|parts.
      Most reliable details seem to be available on MediaTek devices, but I
      have none at my disposal to check. You might get a „green hint“ if that
      source was detected. If that happens, please get in contact with me, so I
      can improve *Adebar* with your help.
* `MK_DEVICEINFO`: Create a (Markdown) document containing device information.
  For an example, see the [[example deviceInfo.md]].
    * `MK_DEVICEINFO_SENSORS`: Sensor details are part of device-info; if you
      wish to ommit it, this is the switch for it. I found this service
      sometimes crashes on one of my devices (`adb shell sensorservice` should
      restart it then)
    * `MK_DEVICEINFO_PMLISTFEATURES`: Though this part is done quickly, you
      might decide it's not useful to you (as it looks a bit cryptic). So I
      decided to give you the change to switch it off :)
    * `MK_DEVICEINFO_STATUS`: Device status details, such as battery status
    * `MK_PARTINFO`: Include details on storage partitions
    * `MK_RADIO`: Show details on the "mobile radio" (SIM etc)? You'll want
       to turn this off e.g. for your WiFi-only tablet.

### UserApp specifics
When an app is installed, Android records the „installer“ together with other
„package details“. This detail is not always available (it is e.g. missing
for pre-installed apps, when you „sideload“ an app via `adb install` or by
installing it from an `.apk` file stored on your device), so we unfortunately
cannot apply that to all apps...

This section has some places pre-configured – but you of course can complement
these settings: the „installer“, if available, is listed with the package
details. Apps are grouped by installers in [[userApps.md|example userApps.md]].

* `APP_INSTALL_SRC[installer.package.name.here]`: How the installer should
  appear in „human readable format“ with your listings.
* `APP_MARKET_URL[installer.package.name.here]`: The full URL of the
  corresponding market. `%s` will be replaced by the package name.

### Miscellaneous Settings
* `PROGRESS`: Show some progress while the script is running, so you know
   what's going on (and don't think it got „stuck“). By default, this is
   enabled. To disable, set it to `0`. To increase verbosity, place a higher
   number (currently used are values from 1 to 4 – feel free to use larger
   numbers for possibly added more-verbose-levels or debug info).
* `USE_ANSI`: Using ANSI sequences, *Adebar* can highlight important parts
   of the progress output: e.g. mark error messages red, titles bold, etc.
   This is fine for interactive use, but might not be wished in scripts.
   Set it to `0` to disable (Default: `1`, i.e. enabled)
* `TIMESTAMPED_SUBDIRS`: Is you want to keep multiple "generations" of the
   created files, this option can come in handy. It will cause *Adebar* to
   create a time-stamped sub-directory on each run. If you e.g. would call
   it `adebar-cli mydevice`, it would store the generated files in a
   directory `mydevice/201412010950` (i.e. YYYYMMDDHHMI as name below the
   name passed at command-line). By default, this is disabled. Note further
   that the optional second command-line parameter would override this.
* `LINK_LATEST_SUBDIR`: With `TIMESTAMPED_SUBDIRS=1`, this option would
   cause *Adebar* to keep a symlink pointing to the always latest copy.
* `KEEP_SUBDIR_GENERATIONS`: With `TIMESTAMPED_SUBDIRS=1`, and when set
   to a value other than `0`, *Adebar* automatically deletes older
   „generations“ and only keeps the specified number. If a „generation“
   seems to contain „real backups“ (i.e. has files in the `$USERDIR`
   of `$SYSDIR` directories, or contains any `.ab` (ADB Backup) or `.gz`
   (GZipped files, e.g. ADB Backups converted using `ab2tar`) files, it
   will not be removed: instead, *Adebar* renames it to `*.Backup` and
   issues a corresponding warning. You will have to take care for those
   yourself then.  
   By default, this is set to `0`, so no automatic purging takes place.
* `POSTRUN_CMD`: When *Adebar* is done extracting all information from
   your device, it optionally can run another command. This could be a
   script, any executable (with or without parameters), or even a function
   you've set up in your config file. This way you could e.g. zip the files
   and send them by mail, or whatever you think useful :)
* `APPNAME_CMD`: Similar to `POSTRUN_CMD` a command to retrieve app names.
  Must return a string only (the app name or, if it fails to retrieve it,
  the package name as passed to it). Only parameter is the package name.
* `ROOT_COMPAT`: Root compatibility mode. By default turned off (`=0`).
  Turn this on (`=1`) when your device is rooted, but the ADB daemon (`adbd`)
  is not running in root mode (i.e. your corresponding device property is
  set to `ro.secure=1` – which you can check with `adb shell getprop ro.secure`;
  note that some devices seem to "lie" here, so the final test would be
  `adb shell ps adb`, which should report whether adbd is run by root). When
  in compatibility mode, some "secured config files" are not simply "pulled"
  (which would remain their timestamps), but "cat" – as that can be done via
  `adb shell` using the `su -c` command.
* `ROOT_PMDISABLE`: Have the `disable` script run the `pm disable` commands
  as root. If they don't show any effect without, this should do the trick
  (provided the device is rooted, of course). Same for the `enable` script
  and its `pm enable` commands.
* `AUTO_CONFIRM`: Whether backups should be automatically confirmed via
  keypresses send with ADB. When using this, don't touch your device while
  the „automated process“ is running: it requires the backup/restore screen
  being in the foreground – or it will hit any other button in reach instead.
  No guarantees, the risk is yours; which is why this is disabled by default.
  Set to `1` if you want to play with it.
* `AUTO_UNLOCK`: Shall the backup/restore scripts try to automatically
  unlock your screen? Note that this a) doesn't work on all devices, b)
  on some devices might require the screen already being turned on, and
  c) definitely doesn't work if a password/pattern/pin protection is active.
  Hence by default this is turned off. Feel free to play with it: in the
  worst case, it simply doesn't work.
* `BASH_LOCATION`: By default, *Adebar* tries to auto-detect the location
  of the `bash` binary using `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. You can override that
  to a preferred fixed location using this variable, e.g.
  `BASH_LOCATION="/bin/bash"` if needed – except for `adebar-cli` itself.
* `WIKI_BASE`: The *Adebar* wiki is available at Codeberg and Github. Using
  this variable, you can decide where wiki links should point to; by default,
  they will go to Codeberg for better privacy. If you run a local mirror of
  the *Adebar* repository incl. its wiki (e.g. using [Gitea](https://gitea.io/),
  you can also point wiki links there.


## User-defined Functions
As described for the `POSTRUN_CMD` and `APPNAME_CMD` above, you can use
„user-defined functions“ to enhance *Adebar*. The example config file
even holds two of them. If you do so, it is recommended to have their
names always starting with `uf_` (for „user function“). This makes sure
they won't collide with any functions defined in `adebar-cli` itself –
whether functions already available there, or added in the future.


## App names
If you ran *Adebar* out-of-the-box, you will notice that even in
[[userApps.md|example userApps.md]], apps are only referenced by their
corresponding package name (e.g. `com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup`). So you will
certainly miss the name you remember the app by (for the given example:
„Titanium Backup“). The reason is quite simple: There is no generic way to
retrieve the names of apps – be it from the device itself, or any other source.
ADB does offer no such feature.

But still, there are ways: to have your `userApps.md` reveal the names for
packages, you can manually create the corresponding cache files:

1. Create a cache directory and inside that, an additional directory
   `appnames`
1. Inside the `appnames` directory, for each app create a corresponding
   file with the name of the package, e.g. `appnames/com.foobar.app`,
   which holds nothing but the app name (e.g. "Foobar App")
1. edit your config, and point the `CACHEDIR` to the cache directory. You can
   use an absolute path (e.g. `/home/me/adebar-cache`), or a relative one (e.g.
   `cache`); in the latter case, this is interpreted as relative to the path
   you're in when running *Adebar* (usually the one `adebar-cli` resides in).

Now *Adebar* will automatically check for each app whether its name is known
here, and use it accordingly.

Alternatively, if the `aapt` binary is found on your device in `/system/bin`,
*Adebar* will automatically use that to retrieve the app names from their
resp. packages on-device (and feed the cache, if configured, so your other
devices profit from it). However, to my knowledge this is only the case for
ROMs from Kitkat (Android 4.4) upwards that are based on CyanogenMod. If your
device does not fall into that category, but is rooted, you can [find the
binary here][1] together with instructions on how to install it on your rooted
device.
