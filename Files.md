# What the files are about and what to do with them

## Files that ship with *Adebar*
* `adebar-cli`: the main command-line script. Run this to generate your backup
  and restore scripts.
* `doc/config.sample`: an example config file. If you do not need support for
  pulling stuff via the *Titanium Backup* built-in web server, and satisfied with
  how things work by default, you can ignore this file. Otherwise, copy or rename
  it to `config` (in the main dir), and adjust it to your needs.
* `doc/AdebarFiles.gv`: Graphviz source of the image below (to visualize
  generated files)
* `LICENSE`: *Adebar* license details (GPLv2)
* `README.md`: general information on *Adebar*
* `tools/ab2tar`: tiny shell script to convert ADB Backups to `.tar.gz`. Requires
   openssl and zlib.
* `tools/getPkgData.php`: a PHP script to parse and analyze the `packages.xml` file.
  This was originally called from `adebar-cli` to create e.g. the `userApps.md`.
  After rewriting that functionality to get rid of the PHP dependency, I've decided
  to keep those files in the distribution as they might be useful for other tasks.
* `tools/xml2array.php`: helper to `getPkgData.php` (converts XML to an PHP array)


## Files generated by *Adebar*
![Adebar-created files](https://github.com/IzzySoft/Adebar/wiki/AdebarFiles.png "Files created by Adebar")

* scripts
    * `deadReceivers.sh`: script which (hopefully) disables those components again,
      e.g. after a factory-reset
    * `defaultInstallLoc`: 1-liner to set the default-install-location for apps
    * `disable`: shell script utilizing ADB to disable packages
    * `partBackup`: script to backup all the partitions of your device
    * `sysbackup`: script to backup all data of your system apps, including shared
      storage (data from the SD cards)
    * `sysrestore`: script to restore the entire system data backed up with `sysbackup`
    * `tibu`: script to pull data via the web server built in to *Titanium Backup*
    * `userbackup`: script to backup all your user apps and their data
    * `userrestore`: script to restore the very same
* documentation
    * `deviceInfo.md`: information on the device, e.g. device-features and properties
    * `userApps.md`: List of installed apps, grouped by their source, with some
      details on them (e.g. date of first install / last update, installed version)
* configuration files pulled from your device(s) if possible (placed into the
  `conf/` sub-directory)
    * `build.prop`
    * `gps.conf`
    * `hosts`
    * `packages.xml`
    * `wpa_supplicant.conf`: contains all your WiFi APs, their passwords, etc.
    * `softap.conf`: contains your WiFi hotspot SSID and password hash

Note that not all of those files are generated in all cases. Some depend on conditions:

* `packages.xml` of course can only be there if *Adebar* was able to pull it.
  Starting with Android 4.1, this requires the ADB daemon to run in root mode.
* `tibu` is only generated when the variable `DEVICE_IP` was set to an IP/hostname
  in the config (by default, it's not/empty), and `MK_TIBU` was set to `1`
  (default is `0`).
* `wpa_supplicant.conf` can only be pulled if the ADB daemon on the device is
  running in root-mode
* some other config files might be „protected“ from being pulled in the same way
  as `wpa_supplicant.conf`


## What to do with the generated files?
Some of them are just intended for reference (the files in the `doc/` and
`conf/` directories). The shell scripts (usually made executable by *Adebar*)
are for you to run, after an optional modification:

* `userbackup`/`sysbackup`: you can comment out apps you don't want to backup,
  then run the scripts to do the job. While being run, `sysbackup` will ask you
  whether to pull „shared storage“ (i.e. contents from your device's SD cards),
  as that is a quite „resource consuming“ job which probably takes quite long
  (depending on how much data there is on the cards), so you can easily skip this
  even with an unmodified script.
* `userrestore`/`sysrestore`: that's the „counter-part“, and holds the restore
  commands for everything that was originally part of the corresponding backup
  script. Again, you will be prompted whether to restore „shared storage“.
* `tibu`: after having started the *Titanium Backup* built-in web server, this
  script can be used to pull what that offers. Basically, „shared storage“ again
  (but external and internal cards separately), plus a ZIP containing all your
  *TiBu* backups.
* `disable`: useful if you had to factory-reset your device, and previously had
  some apps „frozen“ (disabled). Run this script to automatically disable all
  apps you had disabled when *Adebar* created this script.
* `deadReceivers.sh`: similar to the previous point, but for „disabled components“
  (i.e. auto-starts and the likes). Note that this also contains components the
  apps might have disabled themselves based on their configurations (e.g. *Business
  Calendar* does this so you can disable widgets you do not intend to use,
  other apps might have done this if you e.g. disabled their „start on boot“ or
  other functions). While it should do no harm, I can give no guarantees: You
  better check and make sure the script only holds what you need.
* `doc/*`: the files here are for reference, so you can read them :)
* `conf/*`: again, for reference and study.


## What format are the generated files in the `doc/` sub-directory using?
Not a question for those used to *Github*, who probably recognize the `.md`
suffix. This suffix stands for [Markdown], a plain text formatting syntax to
produce well-formatted documents, while still being easy enough to read without
being converted first.

There are different „flavors“ of [Markdown] around. Some of the most common ones
include:

* [Standard Markdown][1], which all flavors are based upon (and which *Adebar*
  sticks to when creating the files in the `doc/` sub-directories)
* [Github flavored Markdown][2] as being used at, hrm, Github
* [Stack Exchange's Markdown][3]
* [Markdown Extra][4]
* and several more

So apart from copying the generated `.md` files to a *Github Gist*, what
alternatives are there to view them in their „formatted way“?

* [ReText][5] is an easy to use editor and viewer for [Markdown], and even
  understands several flavors. It can be extended with plugins, and is
  available for Linux (officially) and Mac.
* [ownCloud][6] has an integrated [Markdown] viewer and editor
* for Windows, there's [MarkdownPad][7] with a look-and-feel quite similar
  to [ReText][5].
* For *Firefox* users, there's the [Markdown Viewer][8] addon
* More alternatives can be found in an article titled
  [78 Tools for Writing and Previewing Markdown][9]
