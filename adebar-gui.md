You might have noticed, there is no fancy user-friendly GUI to Adebar,
everything is working via config files and command-line stuff. Sorry for that.

Second sorry for not promising there will be one – soon or at all. I lack the
time to deal with that – and rather concentrate on adding new features, if I get
some more ideas :)

Still, that doesn't necessarily mean there will be no GUI. ***You*** might
provide one, for example: *Adebar* is open-source, and the code is [available
at Codeberg][1]. So you can fork the project, play with it, add a GUI, and
send a pull-request „upstream“ (to me, that is).


## Suggestion for implementing a GUI
Browsing the code, you might have seen the main script is not simply called
`adebar`, but `adebar-cli`. That was done on purpose, with a GUI pendant in
mind – which should be named `adebar-gui`.

Interfacing with the CLI script shouldn't be a big deal. My "basic ideas" on
how the GUI could work are:

* Using a nice form, it asks the user for settings. It could provide means
  to read defaults from files and save them there (see the `hints.md`
  document on *Configuration*)
* When the „Run“ button is pressed, it writes a temporary config file
  into the `config/` directory, and passes its name to `adebar-cli`.
  When not using one of the user's explicitly stored configs (i.e. when using
  a „temporary file“), additionally to the options described the GUI defines
  the `OUTDIR` variable with what the user wanted it to be. So when „sourcing“
  the config file, `adebar-cli` would be updated accordingly.
* After `adebar-cli` is done, the „temporary config“ (if any) should be removed,
  unless the user requests it to be stored.

The GUI could capture STDOUT and STDERR from the CLI script to provide the user
with feedback.

I possibly missed something here. If you find it, feel free to contact me: Of
course I'm open to make adjustments, when needed, to help the GUI.
